 # Arsema's Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Project Overview : End-To-End Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/ArsemaBesera/HeartDiseaseClassification/blob/master/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.
Data origin: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease
Steps Taken:
* Exploratory data analysis - finding patterns as well as visualizations.
* Data Pre-processing
* Choosing the right machine learning models
* Tuning and improving the model, hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluating the model
* Feature Importance
