 # Arsema's Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: Project Overview : End-To-End Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/ArsemaBesera/HeartDiseaseClassification/blob/master/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.


[Data origin ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)


Steps Taken:
* Exploratory data analysis - finding patterns as well as visualizations.
* Data Pre-processing
* Choosing the right machine learning models
* Tuning and improving the model, hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluating the model
* Feature Importance

## [Project 2: Project Overview : End-To-End Bulldozer Price Prediction](https://github.com/ArsemaBesera/Bulldozer-Price-Prediction/blob/master/Bulldozer%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)

This notebooks looks into using Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for.

2. Data
The data is downloaded from the located here: [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)

Steps Taken: 
* Exploratory data analysis - finding patterns as well as visualizations.
* Data Pre-processing

## [Project 3: Project Overview : Profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio.](https://github.com/ArsemaBesera/Sharpe-Ratio-Project/blob/master/Sharpe%20Ratio%20Complete%20Project.ipynb)

This notebook uses Python-based Pandas library calculating the Sharpe ratio to compare the investments between Facebook and Amazon. 

Steps Taken: 
* Exploratory Data Analysis 
* Calculating Excess Returns
* Sharpe Ratio Pt 1 - Avg Difference in Daily Returns Stocks vs S&P 500
* Sharpe Ratio Pt 2 - Std Deviation of the Return Difference
